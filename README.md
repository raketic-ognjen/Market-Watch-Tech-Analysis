# Market-Watch-Tech-Analysis

In this project I want to show my python coding skills in Google Colaboratory Environment.
Beside this, I will try to show all steps of technical analysis of investment portfolio using next python libraries:
  1. Pandas(pandas data reader)
  2. yfinance
  3. NumPy(linAlg)
  4. SciPy(optimize and stats)
  5. Plotly(graph objects and subplots)
  6. Statsmodels.api

I will do it in 7 steps:
  1. Portfolio Optimization
  2. Efficient Frontiers
  3. CAPM Model
  4. Sharpe's Ratio
  5. Testing Portfolio Performances
  6. Robustness portfolio
  7. Black-Litterman model

After I did this I will compare it with non-technical analysis portfolio (Decision comes from gut and inspiration).

According to non-tech analysis starting portfolio, we use 6 companies:
1. Starbucks - SBUX - 0.13 weight
2. Coca Cola - KO - 0.22 weight
3. Microsoft - MSFT 0.04 weight
4. Pfizer - PFE  0.37 weight
5. Nike - NKE 0.12 weight
6. Exxon Mobil - 0.12 weight

Later Non Technical portfolio  had 83 trades and a lot buying-selling companies, so for this analysis I will use only this 6 stocks

According to TA starting portfolio, we use 6 companies:
1. Astra Zeneca - AZN
2. Nvidia - NVD
3. Under Armour
4. Rivian - RIVN 
5. Carnival Corporation - CCL
6. McDonalds - MCD
